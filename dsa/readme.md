## Notes from lectures

### Array
- Dynamic Array -
  - Inserting at middle or at the start of the dynamic array is not constant time.

### Hashmaps
1. Hashmap uses array & linkedlist to store data.
2. Average CRUD operation is O(1) but worst case is O(n).
3. Resizing happends if the size of the array is filled or 70% or 80%.


### Stacks
1. We can use dynamic array as stack. Eg: Python


### Queue
1. We can't use Dynamic array for performance reason, so LL is usually used to implement it.
2. Enqueue - add a new item
3. DeQueue - delete the last item from tail
